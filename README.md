# WpBuddy, a WordPress vulnerability scanner.

and also my Bachelor's Degree Project :D 

An open-source vulnerability scanner for websites that use WordPress CMS. 
This scanner is useful at identifying and scanning vulnerabilities for the core version and plugins/themes in WordPress and also for testing weak credentials
in the /wp-login page.
You can use http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org for searching the slug of a plugin you want to maunally check on your website.
